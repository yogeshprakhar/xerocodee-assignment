## Cons in Project && Not Completed TASK of Assignment
- didn't configure Babel Configuration for build process, since next.js already use babel (so could not understand the task OR could not completed the task)
- at landing page card background color does not sync with images color { reason: passing color value as props does not changing the card background ui(tried chatgpt solution too, did not worked)  }
